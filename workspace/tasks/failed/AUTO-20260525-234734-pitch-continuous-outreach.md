# Pitch: Continuous Outreach

Easy Simple Sites outreach. Find Massachusetts local businesses with NO website.

- Search 3 cities, 1 category each. Pick cities/categories not used recently (check memory).
- Use find_prospects only. Do NOT use web_research.
- Append new rows to vault/outreach/crm.md using file_editor action=append. NEVER use action=write.
- Row format: | Business | Type | City, MA | phone | call | call_queued | YYYY-MM-DD | notes |
- End: call create_task to queue next run, call write_memory to log cities/categories tried.
